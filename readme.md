# digital-form-builder

DEFRA's digital form builder is a metadata-driven framework that builds on our robust, enterprise backend technical stack and the new gov.uk frontend Design System and allows form based gov.uk sites to be easily built with a graphical design tool.

The framework is flexible. It is capable of handling a number of different scenarios where form based page are required. E.g. Collecting data in a transactional service or checking if a service is suitable for an end user.

Using the graphical design tool, users can build sites from a toolkit of common GDS patterns that includes Pages, Sections and Navigation elements along with Components like Text Fields, Radios Buttons, Checkboxes and Date Fields.
